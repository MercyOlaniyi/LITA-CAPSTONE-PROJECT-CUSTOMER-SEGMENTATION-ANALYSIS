# LITA-CAPSTONE-PROJECT-Customer Subscription Analysis

### Project Overview

This repository contains the code and data for analyzing customer subscription data for a fictional subscription service. The goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription types, and identify trends in cancellations and renewals.

### Dataset Description

The dataset consists of information such as CustomerID, CustomerName, Region, SubscriptionType, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd, Canceled, Revenue

#### Data Source
This is a public dataset that was freely provided by the facilitator.

#### Data Fields

The customer_data excel file contains the following columns:

- CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer

- CustomerName: Name of the customer

- Region: Region of the customer

- SubscriptionType: Type of subscription (Basic, Standard, Premium)

- SubscriptionStart: Start date of the subscription

- SubscriptionEnd: End date of the subscription

- Canceled: Whether the subscription was canceled (TRUE/FALSE)

- Revenue: Revenue generated from the subscription

#### Time Period
The dataset spans from 2022-2024

### Exploratory Data Analysis 

The following insights will be drawn from the dataset

- Key customer segments
  
- Subscription cancellations

- subscription trends.

### Data Preprocessing

Data loading and inspection: To have a general overview of the data

**Data Cleaning Process**

During the initial data inspection, several duplicate rows were identified, which could potentially skew the analysis results. To address this:

**1. Identification of Duplicates:**
   
**- Method:** Conditional formatting in Excel was used to highlight duplicate rows, enabling quick identification of repeated data entries.
  
**2. Removal of Duplicates:**
   
**- Tool:** Excelâ€™s "Remove Duplicates" function was applied to eliminate all duplicate entries from the dataset.
  
**- Fields Considered:** Duplicate checks were conducted across key fields (e.g., customer ID, subscription type, and date fields) to ensure unique records without unintended loss of data.
  
After this cleaning step, the dataset was verified to ensure accuracy and consistency before proceeding with further analysis.

#### Analytical Tools Employed

- Microsoft Excel was used in analysis and summarization of the dataset

- SQL was used to query the data for further insights

- PowerBI was used to visualize the insight drawn from the dataset.
